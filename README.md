# autoSense

A Minimalist Deep learning library

We introduce autoTensor, a wrapped pytorch tensor capable of backpropagation using automatic differntiation. (Even though, pytorch's tensor itself is made for AD :P )

## autoDiff: Reverse Accumulation Mode Automatic Differntiation


### Working documentation

Every function is an autoTensor that has a backpropagation channel to compute the gradients with respect to dependent autoTensor.

#### TODO : Add documentation
